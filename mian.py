1. Setting Up:
You need specific tools (libraries) to run this code. Think of these as special tools in a toolbox.
First, make sure you have installed these tools: requests, BeautifulSoup, numpy, pandas, nltk, and textblob.
After installing, you'll also need to download some extra data for nltk using the nltk.download() command.
2. The Functions:
a. text_file_maker(url, file_id):
This function goes to a website (URL) you provide and grabs the main content and title.
It saves this content into a file on your computer.
It then reads that file, analyzes the text, and gives back a bunch of numbers that describe the content (like how positive or negative it sounds).
b. text_file_maker1(url, file_id):
This is almost the same as the first function but designed for websites with a different structure.
It does the same: gets content, saves it, and then analyzes it.
3. Working with Data:
The code reads information from an Excel file called Output Data Structure.xlsx.
For each website URL listed in this Excel, the code uses one of the two functions mentioned above to fetch content and then analyze it.
The results of this analysis (those bunch of numbers) are added back into the Excel file next to each URL.
4. Handling Problems:
Websites change. They might look different tomorrow than they do today. So, if the code doesn't work for one website, it tries another approach (the second function) to see if that works.
Saving the Results:
After it's done analyzing all the URLs, the code saves all the new information (including the analysis
5. Saving the Results:
After it's done analyzing all the URLs, the code saves all the new information (including the analysis results) back into a new Excel file named output_new_file.xlsx.
6. Tips:
Always be careful when using tools like this. Websites have rules about how you can access their content. If you try to get content too quickly or too often, they might block you.
If you're going to use this code often or share it with others, it's good to add notes or comments in the code to explain what each part does.
